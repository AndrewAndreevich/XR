# XR-110 Extended Reality
##### Spring 2024
## Overview

XR-110  is an introductory course on mixed and augmented reality technologies. Within this course, over the course of a month, we will implement a prototype application for virtual and augmented reality glasses (Oculus Quest 2 and 3). 

As a referencewe take a project implemented in collaboration with the government of Mestia, which is a digital, interactive replica of real terrain ([link 1](https://www.mestiayouth.org/%E1%83%A1%E1%83%98%E1%83%90%E1%83%AE%E1%83%9A%E1%83%94%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%98/%E1%83%9B%E1%83%94%E1%83%A1%E1%83%A2%E1%83%98%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-3d-%E1%83%9B%E1%83%9D%E1%83%93%E1%83%94%E1%83%9A%E1%83%98%E1%83%A0%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%90),[link 2](https://www.mestiayouth.org/%E1%83%A1%E1%83%98%E1%83%90%E1%83%AE%E1%83%9A%E1%83%94%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%98/%E1%83%9B%E1%83%94%E1%83%A1%E1%83%A2%E1%83%98%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-%E1%83%A2%E1%83%94%E1%83%A5%E1%83%9C%E1%83%9D%E1%83%9A%E1%83%9D%E1%83%92%E1%83%98%E1%83%A3%E1%83%A0%E1%83%98-%E1%83%99%E1%83%9A%E1%83%A3%E1%83%91%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-%E1%83%93%E1%83%90%E1%83%A4%E1%83%A3%E1%83%AB%E1%83%9C%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%90))

The objectives of this course consist of several stages.

Initially introduce students to the basics of creating and working with XR technologies in three groups:

[Programming](/XR-110/programming/)

[Visual Design](/XR-110/visual_design/)

[Real-Time Render Engine](/XR-110/rtre/)

Dividing into groups is necessary in order to fit the entire course into a short period of time, not to make the groups too large (no more than 3-4 people) for your comfort, and also to give experience in the interaction of different development departments.
It is important to understand that this course is introductory, in result all groups will work on the same project, looking at it from different points of view. 
However, regardless of the program you choose, recordings of classes in other areas will be available to you and you will be able to view them as they are published or after completing the course.

In the next stage, these groups will be transformed into teams that will implement a prototype for a real project. Within this framework, it will be necessary to interact with external artists - "clients", use a version control system, and project management system. The final stage will be a presentation - exhibition.


#### The main topics to be covered in this course include:

* Modeling
* Scanning
* Installation and use of XR SDK
* Collisions and gestures
* Teamwork
* Git and Github
* Youtrack
* Briefs and Client Interaction

### The structure

Сourse is partly built on how the division and certification is arranged for Unity Technologies company :

{% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/course_images/img_1_sertifications.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

On the other hand, the structural division is combined at one stage in order to make it clear that such projects are almost always the result of coordinated work of different departments of the team.


Classes will be held offline. Groups will consist of 3-4 people. In total, ~9 people will work on the final project, divided into departments by specialization. Language of classes - English

### Teacher 
Aranovich Andrei Andreevich is a specialist in the field of XR development and creation of digital twins with more than 10 years of experience. Winner of the hackathon “Digital Breakthrough 2019” in the category “observation and analysis of human behavior using computer vision” - registered in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest in the world in terms of the number of participants.

## Course Policies

### Prerequisites

Since the course is introductory, the requirements are minimal, but nevertheless you will need basic computer skills and work in graphic and text editors, English language for. It is also advisable to have a laptop for work.


### Recordings

A video recording is being made for internal purposes; you can find the recordings using the links to the general disk with lessons and links for tasks in Youtrack. 

Filming by participants, as well as distribution of internal materials, is not permitted.


### Course attendance policy. 

It is allowed to miss 1-2 classes, which can be made up using records of missed classes and short consultations on an individual basis. 

In case of systematic absence from classes (absence from more than 2 classes) There is no additional time provided to catch up on materials individually. Each such case will be dealt with on an individual basis, but additional class time or refunds will not be provided. A potential solution could be that there is a chance to move the student to the group for the next month if new enrollments are available.


### Organization Style 

To organize our work, we will use a project management system from JetBrains called Youtrack. This system is used in different companies, it also has alternatives like Jira and others. In addition to the convenience of organizing educational and project materials within the course, using this system, students will be able to get acquainted with what the organizational process looks like in large companies. 

To exchange working materials, we will use Git and Github, which will be synchronized with Youtrack for version control within the project. 

All materials on these technologies will be provided both during the course itself and outside of class for individual review.

##### Summer 2024, 10-17 June

  

## Overview

  

XR-110 is a program that aims to provide the audience with a basic understanding of the concept of [Spatial computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_computing/) in an accessible language. Over the course of a week, participants will be involved in working on a prototype of a local map of the region in which they live. This will allow them to become familiar with cultural, economic and other aspects that relate directly to them through the prism of augmented reality technologies.

  
  

Since the topic of Spatial computing is quite complex and has a high entry threshold, in order not to scare off participants, the course is designed as an interactive step-by-step narrative - a set of quests. This was achieved through a number of decisions:

  

1) Several preliminary trips to the area were made ([link 1](https://www.mestiayouth.org/%E1%83%A1%E1%83%98%E1%83%90%E1%83%AE%E1%83%9A%E1%83%94%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%98/%E1%83%9B%E1%83%94%E1%83% A1%E1%83%A2%E1%83%98%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-3d-%E1%83%9B%E1%83%9D%E1%83%93%E1%83%94%E1%83%9A%E1%83%98%E1%83%A0%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%90),[link 2](https://www.mestiayouth.org/%E1%83%A1%E1%83%98%E1%83%90%E1%83%AE%E1%83%9A%E1%83%94%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%98/%E1%83%9B%E1%83%94%E1%83%A1%E1%83%A2%E1%83%98%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-%E1%83%A2%E1%83%94%E1%83%A5%E1%83%9 C%E1%83%9D%E1%83%9A%E1%83%9D%E1%83%92%E1%83%98%E1%83%A3%E1%83%A0%E1%83%98-%E1%83%99%E1%83%9A%E1%83%A3%E1%83%91%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-%E1%83%93%E1%83%90%E1%83%A4%E1%83%A3%E1%83%AB%E1%83%9C%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%90)) which allowed us to form a clear understanding of the audience and the tasks that can be set for it.

  
  

2) Based on the information collected during the field visits (a set of scans), a prototype of an interactive map application was created, which will be used for the visualization of the objectives and results of the course.

3) The format of the educational program consists of a set of missions set by the Youth Self-Government of the Municipality with a focus on gamification of the process.

  

#### The main topics to be covered in this course include:

  

- Spatial computing

### The structure

The program will be divided into a number of stages:

  

- 1) Introduction to the concept of Spatial computing, setting tasks

- 2) Field visits, filming and processing of material

- 3) Integration of material into an existing prototype of the regional map application

- 4) Demonstration of the results of the work to a wide audience

  
  
  

#### 1. Monument to Delica

  
  
  

![](https://andrewandreevich.github.io/XR-110/assets/delika.jpg)

##### Task:

Due to the exceptional technical characteristics and prevalence among the residents of the region, the task was set to create and place a monument to the Mitsubishi Delica on the map. This is the first task that will need to be completed on the course, within its framework, participants will receive basic experience working with objects, and the implementation of the possibility of working on cultural values.

  

##### Stages:

- 1) Find a Delica of a matte texture, which could be easily photographed

- 2) Scan the car,

- 3) Make retopology, and rebake

- 4) Make a design for the monument

- 5) Add rocks, place the Delica on them
