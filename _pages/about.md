# XR-110 Mixed Reality
##### Spring 2024
## Overview

XR-110  is an introductory course on mixed and augmented reality technologies. Within this course, over the course of a month, we will implement a prototype application for virtual and augmented reality glasses (Oculus Quest 2 and 3). As a referencewe take a project implemented in collaboration with the government of Mestia ( [link 1](https://www.mestiayouth.org/%E1%83%A1%E1%83%98%E1%83%90%E1%83%AE%E1%83%9A%E1%83%94%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%98/%E1%83%9B%E1%83%94%E1%83%A1%E1%83%A2%E1%83%98%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-3d-%E1%83%9B%E1%83%9D%E1%83%93%E1%83%94%E1%83%9A%E1%83%98%E1%83%A0%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%90) , [link 2](https://www.mestiayouth.org/%E1%83%A1%E1%83%98%E1%83%90%E1%83%AE%E1%83%9A%E1%83%94%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%98/%E1%83%9B%E1%83%94%E1%83%A1%E1%83%A2%E1%83%98%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-%E1%83%A2%E1%83%94%E1%83%A5%E1%83%9C%E1%83%9D%E1%83%9A%E1%83%9D%E1%83%92%E1%83%98%E1%83%A3%E1%83%A0%E1%83%98-%E1%83%99%E1%83%9A%E1%83%A3%E1%83%91%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-%E1%83%93%E1%83%90%E1%83%A4%E1%83%A3%E1%83%AB%E1%83%9C%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%90)), which is a digital, interactive replica of real terrain.

The objectives of this course are twofold: initially to acquaint students with the basics of creating and working with XR technologies in three groups - Programming, Visual Design, and Real-Time Graphics Engine. In the next stage, these groups will be transformed into teams that will implement a prototype for a real project. Within this framework, it will be necessary to interact with external artists - "clients", use a version control system, and project management system. The final stage will be a presentation - exhibition.

The main topics to be covered in this course include:


* Modeling
* Scanning
* Installation and use of XR SDK
* Collisions and gestures
* Teamwork
* Git and Github
* Youtrack
* Briefs and Client Interaction

##### The structure

Сourse is partly built on how the division and certification is arranged for Unity Technologies company :

On the other hand, the structural division is combined at one stage in order to make it clear that such projects are almost always the result of coordinated work of different departments of the team.

### Teacher 
Aranovich Andrei Andreevich is a specialist in the field of XR development and creation of digital twins with more than 10 years of experience. Winner of the hackathon “Digital Breakthrough 2019” in the category “observation and analysis of human behavior using computer vision” - registered in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest in the world in terms of the number of participants.

### Collaborates 
Goethe Institute, Mestia Municipality, Library about Georgia

### Learning Outcomes

We expect students to gain understanding, fluency in reasoning, and hands-on implementation skills of the following core systems concepts in mixed reality field :

Modeling
*	Low poly
*	Hi poly
*	UV
*	Texturing
*	Materials

Scanning
*	Object Analysis
*	Shooting
*	Model processing
*	Retopology
*	Rebaking

Installation and use of XR SDK
*	Oculus SDK API
*	Gestures

Triggers and Colliders
*	Collision Handling 
*	Running custom scripts

Teamwork

*	Git and Github
*	Youtrack

Briefs and Interactions with Clients
*	How to interact with clients 
*	Healthy Boundaries

### Tasks 

At the first stage (the first 5 lectures), assignments should be completed individually, if any. Assignments will be checked partly during non-classroom hours and partly during lectures. 

At the project stage, tasks will be solved in groups, but the task will be divided into different performers if possible. Review will take place at meetings


### Course Logistics

Library about Georgia on Rustaveli gives the up-to-date office hours of all instructors for this class.

### Checkpoints 
During the course there will be 4 check points, these are: 

###### 01 - Introductory part 
on which we will analyze the specifics of your chosen direction within the XR industry. Let's look at where and how, as well as master the basic software tools. 

###### 02 - Basic training 
Over the course of a series of lessons, we will go through basic concepts and techniques that will help us in working on the project. 

###### 03 - Project part 
Here we will meet with our Artists - “Clients” and learn how to create technical specifications for the project, after which we will apply previously learned techniques in teams to implement the project. 

###### 04 - Presentation and Exhibition 
At this stage, we will organize an event in which we will demonstrate our project to the public.

### Slides from Lectures and Recitations

Will be placed in the course area at: "LINK HERE" soon after each lecture and recitation.
If you are authenticated at Youtrack, you can also access individual directories via links at relevant lesson task
These notes are for your personal use only. Please do not distribute them.

## Course Policies

### Prerequisites

Since the course is introductory, the requirements are minimal, but nevertheless you will need basic computer skills and work in graphic and text editors, English language for. It is also advisable to have a laptop for work.


### Recordings

A video recording is being made for internal purposes; you can find the recordings using the links to the general disk with lessons and links for tasks in Youtrack. 

Filming by participants, as well as distribution of internal materials, is not permitted.


### Course attendance policy. 

It is allowed to miss 1-2 classes, which can be made up using records of missed classes and short consultations on an individual basis. 

In case of systematic absence from classes (absence from more than 2 classes) There is no additional time provided to catch up on materials individually. Each such case will be dealt with on an individual basis, but additional class time or refunds will not be provided. A potential solution could be that there is a chance to move the student to the group for the next month if new enrollments are available.


### Organization Style 

To organize our work, we will use a project management system from JetBrains called Youtrack. This system is used in different companies, it also has alternatives like Jira and others. In addition to the convenience of organizing educational and project materials within the course, using this system, students will be able to get acquainted with what the organizational process looks like in large companies. 

To exchange working materials, we will use Git and Github, which will be synchronized with Youtrack for version control within the project. 

All materials on these technologies will be provided both during the course itself and outside of class for individual review.


### Exhibition 
The completion of the project will be a presentation - an event at which we will demonstrate our work together with the artists participating in the project. The date of the exhibition, preparation for it and other stages will be discussed directly at the training courses.
