# XR-110 Mixed Reality
##### Spring 2024
## Overview

XR-110  is an introductory course on mixed and augmented reality technologies. Within this course, over the course of a month, we will implement a prototype application for virtual and augmented reality glasses (Oculus Quest 2 and 3). As a referencewe take a project implemented in collaboration with the government of Mestia ( [link 1](https://www.mestiayouth.org/%E1%83%A1%E1%83%98%E1%83%90%E1%83%AE%E1%83%9A%E1%83%94%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%98/%E1%83%9B%E1%83%94%E1%83%A1%E1%83%A2%E1%83%98%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-3d-%E1%83%9B%E1%83%9D%E1%83%93%E1%83%94%E1%83%9A%E1%83%98%E1%83%A0%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%90) , [link 2](https://www.mestiayouth.org/%E1%83%A1%E1%83%98%E1%83%90%E1%83%AE%E1%83%9A%E1%83%94%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%98/%E1%83%9B%E1%83%94%E1%83%A1%E1%83%A2%E1%83%98%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-%E1%83%A2%E1%83%94%E1%83%A5%E1%83%9C%E1%83%9D%E1%83%9A%E1%83%9D%E1%83%92%E1%83%98%E1%83%A3%E1%83%A0%E1%83%98-%E1%83%99%E1%83%9A%E1%83%A3%E1%83%91%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-%E1%83%93%E1%83%90%E1%83%A4%E1%83%A3%E1%83%AB%E1%83%9C%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%90)), which is a digital, interactive replica of real terrain.

The objectives of this course are twofold: initially to acquaint students with the basics of creating and working with XR technologies in three groups - Programming, Visual Design, and Real-Time Graphics Engine. In the next stage, these groups will be transformed into teams that will implement a prototype for a real project. Within this framework, it will be necessary to interact with external artists - "clients", use a version control system, and project management system. The final stage will be a presentation - exhibition.

The main topics to be covered in this course include:

```
Modeling
Scanning
Installation and use of XR SDK
Collisions and gestures
Teamwork
Git and Github
Youtrack
Briefs and Client Interaction
```

The structure of the course is partly built on how the division and certification is arranged for Unity Technologies company :
