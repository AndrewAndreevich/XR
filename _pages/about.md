## Overview

XR-110 is a program that aims to provide the audience with a basic understanding of the concept of [Spatial computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_computing/) in an accessible language. Over the course of a week, participants will be involved in working on a prototype of a local map of the region in which they live. This will allow them to become familiar with cultural, economic and other aspects that relate directly to them through the prism of augmented reality technologies. 


Since the topic of Spatial computing is quite complex and has a high entry threshold, in order not to scare off participants, the course is designed as an interactive step-by-step narrative - a set of quests. This was achieved through a number of decisions: 

1) Several preliminary trips to the area were made ([link 1](https://www.mestiayouth.org/%E1%83%A1%E1%83%98%E1%83%90%E1%83%AE%E1%83%9A%E1%83%94%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%98/%E1%83%9B%E1%83%94%E1%83% A1%E1%83%A2%E1%83%98%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-3d-%E1%83%9B%E1%83%9D%E1%83%93%E1%83%94%E1%83%9A%E1%83%98%E1%83%A0%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%90),[link 2](https://www.mestiayouth.org/%E1%83%A1%E1%83%98%E1%83%90%E1%83%AE%E1%83%9A%E1%83%94%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%98/%E1%83%9B%E1%83%94%E1%83%A1%E1%83%A2%E1%83%98%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-%E1%83%A2%E1%83%94%E1%83%A5%E1%83%9 C%E1%83%9D%E1%83%9A%E1%83%9D%E1%83%92%E1%83%98%E1%83%A3%E1%83%A0%E1%83%98-%E1%83%99%E1%83%9A%E1%83%A3%E1%83%91%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-%E1%83%93%E1%83%90%E1%83%A4%E1%83%A3%E1%83%AB%E1%83%9C%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%90)) which allowed us to form a clear understanding of the audience and the tasks that can be set for it. 


2) Based on the information collected during the field visits (a set of scans), a prototype of an interactive map application was created, which will be used for the visualization of the objectives and results of the course.

3) The format of the educational program consists of a set of missions set by the Youth Self-Government of the Municipality with a focus on gamification of the process.

#### The main topics to be covered in this course include:

- Spatial computing
- Modeling
- Scanning
- Working with a ready-made Spatial computing project
- Teamwork

### Course Instructor 

Aranovich Andrei Andreevich is a specialist in the field of XR development and creation of digital twins with more than 10 years of experience. Winner of the hackathon “Digital Breakthrough 2019” in the category “observation and analysis of human behavior using computer vision” - registered in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest in the world in terms of the number of participants.

### Collaborates

The course was created with the support of the Youth Self-Government of the Municipality of Mestia ( მესტიის მუნიციპალიტეტის ახალგაზრდული თვითმმართველობა )


### The Tasks
![](https://andrewandreevich.github.io/XR-110/assets/map.jpg)


### The structure
The program will be divided into a number of stages:

- 1) Introduction to the concept of Spatial computing, setting tasks
- 2) Field visits, filming and processing of material
- 3) Integration of material into an existing prototype of the regional map application 
- 4) Demonstration of the results of the work to a wide audience



#### 1. Monument to Delica



![](https://andrewandreevich.github.io/XR-110/assets/delika.jpg)
##### Task: 
Due to the exceptional technical characteristics and prevalence among the residents of the region, the task was set to create and place a monument to the Mitsubishi Delica on the map. This is the first task that will need to be completed on the course, within its framework, participants will receive basic experience working with objects, and the implementation of the possibility of working on cultural values. 

##### Stages: 
- 1) Find a Delica of a matte texture, which could be easily photographed
- 2) Scan the car, 
- 3) Make retopology, and rebake 
- 4) Make a design for the monument 
- 5) Add rocks, place the Delica on them 
- 6) Determine the place on the map where it will stand 
- 7) Install the monument in the map 
- 8) Build the application

##### Task: 
As part of the project on growing wheat in the region ([link 1](https://www.mestiayouth.org/%E1%83%9E%E1%83%A0%E1%83%9D%E1%83%94%E1%83%A5%E1%83%A2%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%98/%E1%83%9B%E1%83%94%E1%83%AE%E1%83%9D%E1%83%A0%E1 %83%91%E1%83%9A%E1%83%94%E1%83%9D%E1%83%91%E1%83%98%E1%83%A1-%E1%83%92%E1%83%90%E1%83%9C%E1%83%95%E1%83%98%E1%83%97%E1%83%90%E1%83%A0%E1%83%94%E1%83%91%E1%83%90)) it is necessary to visualize the areas involved in the program. 
##### Stages: 
- 1) Find out the boundaries of the areas where wheat is grown. 
- 2) Go to the location and shoot the territory using a drone 
- 3) Make retopology and rebaking 
- 4) Determine the place on the map where it will stand 
- 5) Install the object 
- 6) Display infographics 
- 7) Build the application
